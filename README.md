**Taby is your personal AI assistant and computer buddy.** Chat, manage tasks,
set reminders, and stay focused with the [Taby app](https://www.heytaby.com/setup).

The app works on its own. Want Taby on your desk too? This repo has the
**firmware, animations, and case files** to build a physical Taby.

**Let's make one:** [1. Choose your board](#supported-displays) →
[2. Install the firmware](#bring-taby-to-life) →
[3. Connect to Taby](#connect-to-taby) →
[4. Print a case](#a-home-for-your-taby)

<a id="supported-displays"></a>

## 1. 🖥️ Choose your board

You'll need a supported board and a **USB data cable**.

## 2. ✨ Install the firmware

Plug your board into your computer with the USB data cable. Open an AI agent
that can run commands on that computer, then copy and send this prompt:

```text
Help me install Physical Taby on my connected device.
Read and follow this guide:
https://github.com/TRIIIS-LABS/firmware-taby/blob/main/INSTALL.md

Install any missing USB/ESP32 tools and list the connected ports. If Taby is
already running, read its board metadata. For a blank board or vendor demo,
identify the exact board/revision from its marking or ask me when uncertain;
do not require device identify to succeed before the first flash. Install
the complete matching release, verify it, and play an animation so I can
check the screen.
Then help me connect it to the Taby desktop app.
```

Prefer doing it yourself? **[Follow the installation guide →](INSTALL.md)**

Current firmware: **[1.2.0](https://github.com/TRIIIS-LABS/firmware-taby/releases/tag/v1.2.0)**.

<a id="connect-to-taby"></a>

## 3. 💛 Connect to the Taby app

Once the animation plays correctly, **[get the Taby app](https://www.heytaby.com/setup)**
and follow the [app connection guide](INSTALL.md#5-use-it-with-taby).

We maintain the app connection. For your own integration, use the
[device commands](firmware/README.md#talk-to-taby).
See the guide for [current MCP support](INSTALL.md#5-use-it-with-taby).

## 4. 🏡 Print a case

Your board needs a case. Choose one for your screen, or design your own.

For the Taby 1.64 desktop case, also get an **extra-strong neodymium block
magnet, 20 × 10 × 2 mm**, and **self-adhesive rubber grip tape** or a similar
non-slip rubber sheet to cover the exposed magnet face. See the
[magnet and non-slip covering notes](hardware/README.md#magnet-and-non-slip-covering).

Before printing, check the [printer settings and fit notes](hardware/README.md).
The included G-code is for a **Bambu P1S, 0.4 mm nozzle**; the 3MF uses an
**A1 mini** profile. Using a different printer? Slice the STL or 3MF for yours.

## 🌱 Contribute

New animations, cases, supported boards, and thoughtful fixes are welcome.
Humans and AI agents contribute through the same pull-request workflow.

[Work on firmware](firmware/README.md) · [Contribute a print](hardware/README.md#for-agents-and-contributors) · [Add a board](firmware/README.md#add-a-board)

<details>
<summary><strong>Contributor notes & repository map</strong></summary>

Fork, create a branch, make a focused change, and open a pull request. Read the
firmware guide before editing. For firmware or tooling changes, run
`python tools/check.py` and `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, then build
both supported boards. State which physical board you tested; a build alone
is not a hardware test.

Keep existing USB/Bluetooth/Wi-Fi commands compatible. New boards need their
own configuration, asset pack, and physical test evidence. Keep shared behavior
shared, preserve third-party credits, and never contribute device secrets,
factory records, private keys, or personal logs.

- `firmware/` — ESP-IDF source and board configurations.
- `assets/` — animation and icon packs used by the firmware.
- `hardware/` — printable cases and other physical parts.
- `tools/` — USB setup, installation, builds, and integrity checks.
- `tests/` — checks that don't touch physical hardware.
